# Senescence in American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis

This is a companion repository to the paper entitled ***"Senescence-related genes are associated with the immunopathology signature of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis lesions and may predict progression to mucosal clinical form"*** in which we analyse senescence features in different clinical manifestations of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis.

The paper is under submission at the moment.

## 3-dimensional Volcano Plot

For viewing the interactive 3D Volcano Plot, please follow the link: [ATL 3D Volcano](https://cfantecelle.github.io/senescence_ATL/results/volcano3D.html)

<br>

## Personal Package

Some functions used in the `senescence_ATL.R` script come from a personal package I use to store useful functions (such as calculating coordinates for manually positioning statistics results in ggplots). These functions can be checked in the [CompBioTools package](https://github.com/cfantecelle/CompBioTools_package) repository.
